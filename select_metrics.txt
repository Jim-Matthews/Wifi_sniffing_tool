This text file explains the -b, --features, flag for wifi_sniffing_tool.py
The flag takes an integer and uses it too determine which metrics to analyse. 

| Integer	|  Metrics	|
|-------------------------------|
| 1		|  RSSI		|
| 2		|  Rate		|
| 4		|  NAV		|
| 8		|  Seq		|
| 16 		|  TTL		|
|-------------------------------|

Examples:

Using -b 2 would specify only Rate to be used as metric when detcting attacks.
Using -b 24 would specify both Seq and TTL to be used as metrics for detecting attacks.
Using -b 31 would specify all metrics to be used for detecting attacks.
